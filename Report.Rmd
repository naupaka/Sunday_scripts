This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary(iris)
```


```{r, engine='bash'}
ls
```

```{r, engine='python'}
print "hello from python"
```

The mean value of sepal length in the iris study is `r mean(iris$Sepal.Length)`

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length,iris$Sepal.Width, main = "My figure")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
